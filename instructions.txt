**React Quiz App Assignment**
**Due Date:** Tomorrow by 2:00 PM
**Objective**: Build a simple multiple-choice quiz application using React.
This project will help you learn React fundamentals and prepare you for future tasks in building dApps.

Each question should be an object containing:
- The question text
- An array of options
- The correct answer

Create an array of several question objects (can be hard-coded, but feel free to use an API if you want)
Use React state to track user's answers as they progress through the quiz
Display the final result once the quiz is completed

User Interface:
- Present one question at a time
- Allow users to select an answer for each question
- Provide a way to move to the next question and return to a previous question
- Show the final score at the end of the quiz


Learning Objectives:
- Handle user interactions and update the UI accordingly
- Break down the app into smaller components for better organization
- Use React Hooks and custom hooks where necessary

Tips
Refer to React documentation and tutorials as you work on this project


Be prepared to walk us through your code and interface in class.
Good luck
